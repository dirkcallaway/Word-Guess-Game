# Word-Guess-Game

## Overview
In this word guess game you will guess letters using your keyboard to try and figure out the mystery word. Each word relates to the Netflix show Stranger Things.

The game will randomly choose a word and you have 10 guesses to complete it. If you complete the word it will be added to your finished word bank. If you run out of guesses, a new word will be created and the game resets.

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with JavaScript and user interactions.

## Guessing
Simply press a letter on your keyboard to make a guess.  The letter is then added to the guessed letter box and if it is in the word, displayed in its appropriate spot.  Your remaining guesses are displayed to the right... Be careful not to run out!
